# Project1 

# DESCRIPTION 
This program will make up a sound of beep after the timing given by you.
It takes the timing in minutes.
Follow the instruction given below to run program.
I have provided a default alarm_beeps.mp3  sound file for you.
Digital clock will run simontaneously until it is time beep.



# HOW To RUN THIS FILE
In terminal just go to the place where you have downloaded these file.
and type : ``` $python3 alarm.py 1 ```


Second argument is just the file name and third is the timing provided by you.



# Customization
Just make sure both the files are in same place or you can just change the file path for 
alarm_beeps.mp3 in ``` line 47 ```
``` playsound ('your file path') ```

Or you can download your own notification file and put the path for that file in line 47.
